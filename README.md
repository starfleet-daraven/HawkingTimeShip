We are a military styled annex of STARFLEET INTERNATIONAL FAN ASSOCIATION'S Long Beach Chapter USS Stephen Hawking. The Stephan Hawking’s Ultimate mission is classified and compartmentalized. As the more military like aspect of the same Science Fiction Fan Club, we focus on community safety and neighborhood preparedness because we like the big BANG BANG we don’t focus on it.

Here on the Hawking we would like to embrace all Science Fiction, not only Star Trek which is our primary platform through www.sfi.org where we can attend the extensive Starfleet Academy and learn how the parent club works and other things where you can attain the fictional military ranks associated with Star Trek. 

Yet we enjoy CosPlay, Dr. Who, Babylon 5, Battlestar Glactica, Fan Fiction and Fan Artwork and just about anything fun. Remember this is all part of our classified mission parameters.
